# Project Name

## Overview

This repository documents the integration of an Order and Delivery Management System (ODMS) with a 3rd party Point of Sale (POS) and SQL database for efficient order processing, inventory tracking, and data management. The fully customizable ODMS system can be implemented to seamlessly integrate with a 3rd party POS system and SQL database, replacing Off-the-self systems.

## System Components

### 1. Order and Delivery Management System (ODMS)

ODMS is the core component responsible for managing orders, recording inventory transactions, and serving as a data warehouse for key indicators related to inventory movements.

### 2. 3rd Party Point of Sale (POS)

A 3rd party POS system will serve as the frontend for order submission, and it will communicate seamlessly with ODMS to ensure real-time recording of transactions and accurate inventory tracking.

### 3. SQL Database

An external SQL database will be used together with the native sqlite3 database that ships with Django. The external database will serve as the source of truth for the system, storing approved entries from ODMS and facilitating efficient data retrieval.

## Integration Workflow

1. **Order Submission:**
   - Customers will submit orders through the 3rd party POS system.
   - The POS will communicate with ODMS to record orders in real-time.

2. **Inventory Tracking:**
   - ODMS will record stock movements as they occur, ensuring accurate and up-to-date inventory tracking.

3. **Data Warehouse:**
   - ODMS will serve as a data warehouse, hosting key indicators related to inventory movements for easy access and analysis.

4. **Error Detection:**
   - The real-time recording of transactions in ODMS will enable quick detection of data entry errors.

5. **Visibility into Stock Movements:**
   - ODMS will provide quick visibility into stock movements, allowing for timely decision-making.

6. **Push to Source of Truth Database:**
   - Approved entries will be pushed from ODMS to an external SQL database, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

## Benefits

- **Quicker Detection of Data Entry Errors:** Real-time recording enables swift error identification and correction.
  
- **Enhanced Visibility:** ODMS provides quick visibility into stock movements for better decision-making.

- **Efficient Data Management:** The external SQL database acts as a reliable source of truth, ensuring data accuracy and integrity.

This integration aims to streamline the order and inventory management processes, offering a more efficient and error-resistant solution for any FMCG business. Feel free to refer to the documentation for further details and implementation guidelines.
